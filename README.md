# Signet

Replace bearer tokens with cryptographic proof-of-possession. Signet provides tools for signing commits, files, and HTTP requests using ephemeral certificates with algorithm agility (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-44 post-quantum).

## ⚠️ Status: v0.3.0 Beta (prerelease) — Experimental

`v0.3.0` is published as a **GitHub prerelease** and is soaking. Every Signet
release publishes that way and never self-promotes to "latest": production
status is an explicit human step taken only after the verification gate passes
from a clean machine. A release still badged "Pre-release" has not completed
promotion. See [the promotion plan](docs/release/goal-zero-promotion.md).

`v0.3.0` is the first release whose artifacts are **signed by Signet itself**.
Verify any download without trusting this page — the trust anchor is fetched
from the authority, not from the release:

```bash
task verify-release TAG=v0.3.0
```

**Known limitations in v0.3.0:** `signet authority exchange-github-token` and
`signet auth register` are non-functional against the default authority (both
endpoints return 404). CI/CD signing — the path this project's own releases
are signed through — is unaffected. See the
[release notes](docs/release/notes/v0.3.0.md).

**Security Note:**
- **Not audited** - use for development only
- **No certificate transparency.** Artifact signatures are logged to public
  Rekor, but certificate *issuance* is not: the authority does not issue
  RFC 6962 SCTs, so signing runs with `--insecure-ignore-sct`. You can prove a
  signature was logged; you cannot audit what certificates the authority
  issued, and a certificate minted but never used to sign appears nowhere.
  Closing this needs the authority to run a transparency log *and* signet to
  require an SCT — a log nobody enforces is a sample, not a record.
- Core cryptography is unit-tested (13k+ LOC) and partially fuzzed (3 fuzz functions covering critical parsing paths)
- Native Go implementation via [`go-cms`](https://github.com/agentic-research/go-cms) (no external review, passes OpenSSL interop tests)
- **Platform:** Built for macOS, should work on Linux (minimal testing)
- **Key storage:** Defaults to OS keyring; falls back to plaintext `~/.signet/master.key` when the keyring is unavailable or initialized with `--insecure`
- TouchID integration (macOS) requires CGO; Linux/CI builds are Pure Go (Static)
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security limitations and best practices

## What Works Today

### 1. Git Commit Signing

Replace GPG with modern Ed25519 signatures:

```bash
# Build and install
task install

# Initialize
signet-git init

# Configure Git
git config --global gpg.format x509
git config --global gpg.x509.program signet-git
git config --global user.signingKey $(signet-git export-key-id)

# Sign commits
git commit -S -m "Signed with Signet"
```

**Features:**
- 5-minute ephemeral certificates from local CA
- OpenSSL-compatible CMS/PKCS#7 signatures
- Sub-millisecond performance (~0.12ms)
- Completely offline

### 2. General File Signing

Sign any file with the same primitives:

```bash
# Initialize with Ed25519 (default, shares keys with git signing)
./signet sign --init

# Or initialize with ML-DSA-44 (post-quantum)
./signet sign --init --algorithm ml-dsa-44

# Sign files
./signet sign document.pdf
# Creates document.pdf.sig

# Verify with OpenSSL (Ed25519 signatures)
openssl cms -verify -binary -in document.pdf.sig -inform PEM
```

### 3. HTTP Authentication Middleware

Two-step verification middleware for Go HTTP servers:

```go
import "github.com/agentic-research/signet/pkg/http/middleware"

auth, err := middleware.SignetMiddleware(
    middleware.WithMasterKey(masterPubKey),
    middleware.WithClockSkew(30*time.Second),
)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
handler := auth(yourHandler)
```

**Features:**
- Ephemeral proof verification (master→ephemeral→request)
- Replay attack prevention
- Pluggable token/nonce stores (memory, Redis with `redis` build tag)
- Clock skew tolerance
- **Token revocation** via SPIRE-model CA bundle rotation

See [`pkg/http/middleware/README.md`](./pkg/http/middleware/README.md) for details.

### 4. OIDC Identity Bridge

Mint X.509 client certificates from OIDC login (Fulcio-style).

The hosted authority at [`auth.notme.bot`](https://auth.notme.bot) handles this automatically — no self-hosting required. For self-hosted deployments, see the [`notme/worker`](https://github.com/agentic-research/notme) repo (CF Worker) or run the Go authority server directly:

```bash
./signet authority --config config.json
```

See [`cmd/signet/authority.go`](./cmd/signet/authority.go) for Go server configuration details.

### 5. MCP Client Authentication

One-command onboarding for MCP endpoints with mTLS. The CLI will prompt for your Dashboard and MCP URLs on first run and save them to `~/.signet/config.json`.

```bash
# Interactive (prompts for URLs on first run, then opens browser)
signet auth login

# Headless (prompts for URLs if not configured, then registers)
signet auth register --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Check certificate status
signet auth status
```

**Features:**
- **Zero Configuration**: Prompts for setup if defaults are not defined.
- OAuth2 + PKCE browser flow with localhost callback (`signet auth login`)
- GitHub token one-shot registration for headless/CI agents (`signet auth register`)
- ECDSA P-256 keypair generated locally (private key never leaves machine)
- For browser login: refresh token stored for automatic cert renewal
- For register: no refresh token; re-registers when cert is near expiry
- Auto-configures Claude Code (`claude mcp add`)
- Idempotent: re-running reuses an existing valid cert or renews when needed

### 6. GHA OIDC Signing (CI/CD)

Sign artifacts in GitHub Actions using ambient OIDC credentials (no secrets needed).

The language-neutral Signet Action works for Rust, Go, JavaScript, Python, or
any repository that produces files:

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5
      - run: cargo build --release
      - uses: agentic-research/signet/.github/actions/sign-artifact@<immutable-commit-sha>
        with:
          artifacts: |
            target/release/my-rust-binary
            checksums-sha256.txt
          authority-url: https://<cloister-host>/identity
```

The Action exchanges a GHA OIDC token for a five-minute Notme certificate,
holds the matching Ed25519 key only in memory, signs through the standard
`signet://session` KMS URI, and verifies every bundle before returning. Point
`authority-url` at a Cloister cluster's `/identity` route to use its
cluster-local Notme CA.

**Features:**
- Zero secrets stored in repo (uses GHA ambient OIDC identity)
- Language-neutral artifact paths
- Standard cosign bundles and immediate verification
- Bridge certificates with capability X.509 extensions
- Policy-based authorization (repo, workflow, ref filtering)

### Sigstore KMS Plugin

Use Signet keys with the Sigstore ecosystem (cosign, gitsign):

```bash
# Build and install the plugin
go build -o sigstore-kms-signet ./cmd/sigstore-kms-signet
mv sigstore-kms-signet /usr/local/bin/

# Sign artifacts with cosign using your Signet key (uploads to Rekor by default)
cosign sign-blob --key signet://default --tlog-upload=true artifact.bin > artifact.sig
```

The `--tlog-upload` and Rekor verification flags are handled entirely by `cosign`; the `sigstore-kms-signet` plugin only signs the digest it receives over the KMS plugin protocol.

See [`docs/sigstore-integration.md`](./docs/sigstore-integration.md) for full setup, including a "Verifying via Rekor" section with copy-pasteable `cosign verify-blob` commands.

### Reverse Proxy (signet-proxy)

Authenticate multiple clients via Signet proofs, forwarding requests with a shared upstream token:

```bash
go build -o signet-proxy ./cmd/signet-proxy
./signet-proxy --upstream-token $GITHUB_TOKEN --listen :8080
```

See [`cmd/signet-proxy/README.md`](./cmd/signet-proxy/README.md) for details.

### Token Revocation System

SPIRE-model revocation using CA bundle rotation and epoch-based invalidation:

**Features:**
- **Instant revocation** of compromised keys via CA rotation
- **Rollback protection** with monotonic sequence numbers
- **Fail-closed design** - infrastructure failures deny access
- **Grace periods** for smooth key rotation
- **Offline-first** - no CRL/OCSP dependency

**How it works:**
```go
// Configure revocation checker
fetcher := cabundle.NewHTTPSFetcher(bundleServerURL, nil)
storage := cabundle.NewMemoryStorage()
cache := cabundle.NewBundleCache(30 * time.Second)
checker := revocation.NewCABundleChecker(fetcher, storage, cache, bundleSigningPublicKey)

// Add to middleware
auth, err := middleware.SignetMiddleware(
    middleware.WithRevocationChecker(checker),
)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
handler := auth(yourHandler)
```

Tokens are automatically checked against the CA bundle for:
- Epoch validity (instant revocation of old epochs)
- Key ID matching (CA rotation detection)
- Sequence number monotonicity (rollback attack prevention)

See [`docs/design/006-revocation.md`](./docs/design/006-revocation.md) for architecture details.

## Installation

### From a Release (verify the signature)

Release binaries are signed in CI with the cosign-compatible Signet KMS Action.
Each ships a Sigstore bundle and a five-minute Notme certificate. **Verify
before running** — pinning the Notme/Cloister CA is what distinguishes a key
certified for this workload from one an artifact-replacement attacker created.

```bash
VERSION=vX.Y.Z                     # the release you are installing
PLATFORM=linux-amd64               # or darwin-arm64, linux-arm64
BASE=https://github.com/agentic-research/signet/releases/download/$VERSION

curl -fLO $BASE/signet-$PLATFORM
curl -fLO $BASE/signet-$PLATFORM.sigstore.json
curl -fLO $BASE/signet-$PLATFORM.signet.crt.pem

# Obtain this CA from the configured authority's trust channel, not from the
# release assets you are trying to authenticate. The public-authority default is:
curl -fsS https://auth.notme.bot/.well-known/ca-bundle.pem \
  -o trusted-notme-ca.pem

openssl verify \
  -CAfile trusted-notme-ca.pem \
  signet-$PLATFORM.signet.crt.pem

openssl x509 \
  -in signet-$PLATFORM.signet.crt.pem \
  -noout -ext subjectAltName
# Require URI:wimse://notme.bot/gha/agentic-research/signet (or the
# cluster's configured equivalent).

AUTHORITY=https://auth.notme.bot
IDENTITY=wimse://notme.bot/gha/agentic-research/signet

cosign trusted-root create \
  --with-default-services \
  --no-default-ctfe \
  --fulcio="url=$AUTHORITY,certificate-chain=trusted-notme-ca.pem" \
  --out trusted-signet-root.json

cosign verify-blob \
  --trusted-root trusted-signet-root.json \
  --certificate-identity "$IDENTITY" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp '^$' \
  --insecure-ignore-sct \
  --bundle signet-$PLATFORM.sigstore.json \
  signet-$PLATFORM

chmod +x signet-$PLATFORM && mv signet-$PLATFORM /usr/local/bin/signet
```

If `SIGNET_AUTHORITY_URL` points at a Cloister cluster, provision that cluster's
pinned Notme CA instead of the public-authority URL above. Do not trust the
`.signet.ca.pem` copied beside a release merely because it is present there;
an attacker who can replace every release asset could replace that file too.
`--insecure-ignore-sct` is required because Notme bridge certificates are not
Fulcio CT certificates; it does not disable the Rekor inclusion proof checked
from the bundle.

`checksums-sha256.txt` is published and signed too, but it is not a substitute:
checksums tell you a download is intact, not who produced it.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentic-research/signet.git
cd signet
task build
```

Produces `./signet` and `./signet-git` binaries.

### Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- OpenSSL (for verification)

## Architecture

Signet is a set of cryptographic primitives with tools built on top:

```mermaid
block-beta
    columns 1
    block:tools["Tools"]
        columns 6
        signetgit["signet-git"]
        signetsign["signet sign"]
        signetauth["signet auth"]
        signetauthority["signet authority"]
        signetproxy["signet-proxy"]
        sigstorекмс["sigstore-kms"]
    end
    block:middleware["Middleware / Protocol"]
        columns 4
        httpmw["HTTP middleware"]
        revocation["Revocation"]
        oidc["OIDC providers"]
        policy["Policy eval"]
    end
    block:core["Core Primitives (pkg/)"]
        columns 6
        cms["CMS (go-cms)"]
        cose["COSE"]
        epr["EPR"]
        tokens["Tokens"]
        localca["LocalCA"]
        bridge["Bridge certs"]
    end
    block:algo["Algorithm Registry"]
        columns 2
        ed25519["Ed25519 (default)"]
        mldsa["ML-DSA-44 (post-quantum)"]
    end

    tools --> middleware --> core --> algo
```

All tools share the same master key, certificate authority, and keystore.

## Roadmap

Signet is in **alpha** (v0.2.0).

**Recent (v0.2.0):**
- ✅ GHA OIDC end-to-end signing flow (ambient identity, bridge certs, policy)
- ✅ Cloudflare Access OIDC provider
- ✅ MCP client authentication (`signet auth login/register`)
- ✅ Post-merge re-signing workflow
- ✅ Security audit: 7 findings fixed (JTI race, serial collision, rate limiter hardening)
- ✅ Edge identity authority at [`auth.notme.bot`](https://auth.notme.bot) (CF Worker, zero secrets)
- ✅ Cap'n Proto schemas for cross-language type parity ([`notme/schema`](https://github.com/agentic-research/notme/tree/main/schema))

**Current focus:** Go workspace refactor, OAuth port to edge.

**Gaps before v1.0:**
- Security audit (required before production use)
- Go workspace structure (`go.work` with `authority/` as importable module)
- Port remaining OAuth flows to CF Worker (eliminate Fly dependency)
- Signature verification CLI (`signet verify`)

## Why Signet?

**Problem:** Bearer tokens (API keys, JWTs, OAuth tokens) are "steal-and-use" credentials. If an attacker gets your token, they are you. Every attempted fix leaves the core vulnerability intact:

```

**Solution:** Cryptographic proof-of-possession. Every request proves knowledge of a private key without revealing it. Tokens can't be stolen and replayed.

**Unique features:**
- One of the first Go libraries with Ed25519 CMS/PKCS#7 support (via [go-cms](https://github.com/agentic-research/go-cms), not yet security reviewed)
- **Post-quantum ready** via ML-DSA-44 (FIPS 204) using [cloudflare/circl](https://github.com/cloudflare/circl)
- Offline-first design (no network dependencies)
- Ephemeral certificates (5-minute lifetime)
- Sub-millisecond verification
- OpenSSL-compatible output
